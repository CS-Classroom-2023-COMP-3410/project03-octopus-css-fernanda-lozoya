Here’s a CSS file that you can use to style your HTML webpage as described.

### Explanation:

1.  **`body`**: Sets the background color and removes default margins and padding for a clean layout.
2.  **`.title-container`**: Ensures the title and subtitle are centered and their text color is white.
3.  **`.gradient-box`**: Creates a full-width rectangle with a gradient background and rounded corners.
4.  **`h1` and `h2`**: Styles the title and subtitle to your specified font sizes and ensures proper spacing.

You can include this CSS file in your HTML by linking it in the `<head>` section:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`

Make sure to apply the appropriate classes (`.title-container` and `.gradient-box`) in your HTML structure for this CSS to take effect. Let me know if you’d like help with the HTML setup!

If the CSS is linked correctly but the title styling doesn't work, ensure:

1.  **Correct HTML Structure**: Your HTML must use the classes (`.title-container`) and tags (`h1`, `h2`) specified in the CSS. For example:
    
    `<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head>     <meta charset="UTF-8">     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">     <title>Styled Page</title>     <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> <!-- Make sure the path is correct --> </head> <body>     <div class="gradient-box">         <div class="title-container">             <h1>Main Title</h1>             <h2>Subtitle</h2>         </div>     </div> </body> </html>`
    
2.  **Correct Path to the CSS File**:
    
    *   Ensure the `href` attribute in the `<link>` tag points to the right location of your CSS file. If your CSS file is in the same directory as your HTML file, this should work:
        
        `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`
        
    *   If the CSS file is in a folder, adjust the path, e.g., `css/style.css`.
        
3.  **Clear Browser Cache**:
    
    *   Sometimes browsers cache files. To ensure your CSS changes are reflected, reload the page while bypassing the cache (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`).
4.  **Verify Class/Tag Usage**:
    
    *   Ensure the `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags are inside an element with the class `title-container`.

### Debugging Tips:

*   Add a quick test style directly in your HTML to confirm the link works:
    
    `<style>     h1 { color: red; } </style>`
    
    If the title turns red, the problem is in the CSS file or the path.
    
*   Check your browser's developer tools:
    
    1.  Right-click on the title and select **Inspect**.
    2.  In the "Styles" panel, verify if your CSS rules are applied. If not, look for errors like "file not found" in the "Console" tab.
