I think the challenges I faced were honestly due to just lack of practice and familairity with the way css and html interact together. At first I really tried to limit the use of GPT. The strategy was to attempt to keep moveing forward with the available tools, but as I struggled I used more gpt. For instance, there's a spot where I got lost and my code was a little confusing compared to the answers gpt was providing. Therefore, I would provide gpt with all the code I had and asked it where I was going wrong. I would also ask it to combine my code with what it gave me to avoid confusion. There were instances where I did just ask it to help me figure something out if I absolutely could not tackle a way to do things. For instance, the table I really struggled with on my own. After asking GPT it makes sense how one would approach formatting and styling tables. I think I learned a lot based on the strategy I utilized with this web page. I think as the course progresses we'll be able to use gpt less and less.
